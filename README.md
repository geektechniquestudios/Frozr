### What is Frozr?
  Frozr is a minimal web service that enables you to store cryptocurrency in a time-locked smart-contract.

### How Safe is it?
  Completely. The contract holds your funds for exactly as long as you specify. The contract is verified, so you can trust the code in the contract to match what is show on the block explorer.

### Why is it free
  Because something like this shouldn't cost anything.
  
### How was it made?
  The primary technologies used to make Frozr were Yarn, Vite, TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, Solidity, and Ethersjs. 

### Troubleshooting
"Metamask isn't installed"
To use this website, you'll need a smart wallet. (Metamask)[https://metamask.io/download/] is recommended.
"What if the site goes down?"
 The smart contract works independently of the website. Even if Frozr were to completely dissapear, the contract will still operate indefinitely, keeping your funds safe.
