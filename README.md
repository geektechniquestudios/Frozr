  Check it out at [frozr.io](https://frozr.io)

### What is Frozr?
  Frozr is a minimal web service that enables you to safely store cryptocurrency in a time-locked smart-contract vault.

### Why is it free
  Because something like this shouldn't cost anything.
  
### Technologies
  Frozr was built using Yarn, Vite, TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, Solidity, and Ethersjs. 

<!-- ### Troubleshooting
  "Metamask isn't installed"
  To use this website, you'll need a smart wallet. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download/) is recommended.
  "What if the site goes down?"
   The smart contract works independently of the website. Even if Frozr were to completely dissapear, the contract will still operate indefinitely, keeping your funds safe. -->
