### Technologies
  Frozr was built using Yarn, Vite, TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, Solidity, and Ethersjs. 

### Verification
  All of Frozr's smart-contracts have verified source code that you can easily inspect. Visit the site and scroll down for links to the contracts.

<!-- ### Troubleshooting
  "Metamask isn't installed"
  To use this website, you'll need a smart wallet. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download/) is recommended.
  "What if the site goes down?"
   The smart contract works independently of the website. Even if Frozr were to completely dissapear, the contract will still operate indefinitely, keeping your funds safe. -->
